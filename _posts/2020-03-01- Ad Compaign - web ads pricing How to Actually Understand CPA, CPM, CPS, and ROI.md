> Running ads online feels like playing a game where the rules change mid-match — and half the time, you’re not even sure which scoreboard you’re looking at. CPA, CPM, CPS… sound familiar? Whether you're launching a product, managing a small budget, or just trying to make sense of campaign metrics, this guide breaks it all down. No jargon, just clarity.

## 📌 CPA – Cost Per Action (Most Common Online)
**Great for advertisers who want control over their spend.**

- You only pay when a user completes a desired action (e.g., filling a form, purchasing, signing up).
- No matter how many people see your ad, you only get charged for conversions.
- _Example: 10,000 views might only bring 40 conversions. You only pay for the 40._

**🧠 Platforms that use CPA:**
- Amazon Affiliates
- Appsflyer and other app tracking platforms

---

## 📌 CPS – Cost Per Sale
**Performance-based: you pay only when someone makes a purchase.**

- Common in affiliate and influencer marketing.
- You reward creators or platforms only when they bring actual sales.

**🛒 Examples:**
- JD Affiliates / Taobao Union
- Shopify partner referrals

---

## 📌 CPM – Cost Per Thousand Impressions
**Best for visibility and brand awareness.**

- Pay for every 1,000 views, regardless of user actions.
- Great when your goal is getting noticed, not necessarily clicked.

**📱 Common platforms:**
- News portals like Sina, Netease
- Meta Ads (Facebook, Instagram)

---

## 🔁 Hybrid Models: CPA + CPM
**Start wide (CPM), then narrow (CPA).**

Use CPM to drive awareness, then shift to CPA to optimize conversions.

_Example: Run CPM ads on Zhihu for visibility, then switch to CPA as interest builds._

## 💡 ROI – Return on Investment
**Formula:** `((Revenue - Cost) ÷ Cost) × 100%`

_Example:_ You spend ¥20,000 on ads, earn ¥60,000 in revenue:
```
((60,000 - 20,000) ÷ 20,000) × 100% = 200% ROI
```
A high ROI = successful campaign. A low one? Time to analyze and adapt.

## 💰 Estimating Your Ad Budget
Here’s how to break it down:

- **Conversion Rate** = Buyers ÷ Registrants
- **Net Profit Per Unit** = Selling Price - Product Cost
- **Max Acceptable Ad Spend Per Unit** = Selling Price - Minimum Profit You’re Willing to Keep

_Example:_ If a product sells for ¥1600 and you need ¥400 profit, you can spend up to ¥1200 on ad costs per unit.

## 🧭 AARRR Framework (a.k.a. Pirate Metrics)
Breaks growth into 5 clear stages:

### 1. Acquisition
Where are users coming from?
- Channels: SEO, social, paid ads, referrals

### 2. Activation
Are users having a good first experience?
- Metrics: First session time, sign-up rate, first click actions

### 3. Retention
Do they come back?
- Track 1/3/7/30-day retention
- DAU/MAU ratios, bounce rates, session length

### 4. Revenue
Are they paying?
- Metrics: ARPU, ARPPU, CLV

### 5. Referral
Are they inviting others?
- K-factor: avg. number of users each user brings
- Think: viral loops, invite bonuses

> There’s no one-size-fits-all ad strategy — each model fits different goals. If you want conversions, CPA is your tool. Want reach? Use CPM. Want proof of ROI? Track it. And if you want long-term growth, the AARRR framework can guide you.
