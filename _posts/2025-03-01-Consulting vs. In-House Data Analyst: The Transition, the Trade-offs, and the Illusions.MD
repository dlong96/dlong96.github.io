title: "From Consulting to In-House: A Data Analyst’s Shift in Role, Thinking, and Frustration"
subtitle: "Observations, confusion, and the small realizations in between"

I spent 4+ years doing data work in consulting — building dashboards, answering business questions, closing the file. But something always felt off. Like the real decisions were happening elsewhere.

So I talked to 20+ in-house data analysts. I listened. And I started to reflect — not just on my job, but on the **shape of the role** itself.

## What this post includes:

- What it feels like to do data work in consulting  
- Why in-house sounds better — and maybe isn’t  
- What I’ve been trying to change in myself  
- Some honest thoughts on resumes, dashboards, and being more than a tool

## 1. What it feels like to do data work in consulting

As someone working in data analytics within a consulting company, you rarely own the problem.  
You're handed a request by a business unit — usually just one — and that team may not even operate independently. Their data comes from somewhere else, the decision is influenced elsewhere, and they still expect you to deliver an answer.

You’re a third party to a fragment of a question.  

In many cases, consulting projects try to cut costs by limiting your exposure. You’re told to only speak with your assigned contact. Cross-departmental discussions? “Too complex.”  
So you sit with incomplete data, unclear logic, and hope the dashboard you create won't mislead someone down the line.

And when things go wrong, you don’t usually hear about it. Unless the client reports an issue, you might never know if your analysis was used — or ignored.

## 2. Why in-house seems like the way out

Naturally, I started to think: maybe this isn’t what analytics is supposed to feel like.  
Maybe I’m just in the wrong place.

In-house roles promise something else:

- Access to systems end-to-end  
- The ability to follow up and track impact  
- Working with teams long enough to understand how decisions are made  
- Being seen as a partner, not an outsider with a fancy PDF

All of that sounded more human. More grounded. Less like I’m building tools for someone else's decisions that I never get to see.

I started imagining: maybe as an in-house analyst, I’d finally be close enough to the business to ask the real questions.  
Maybe I’d be able to sit in the same room when a product decision is made. Maybe I’d even get to say, “Hey, here’s what the data suggests — maybe we should test this instead.”

That was the hope.

## 3. But in-house isn’t exactly the paradise either

Here’s where I want to pause.  
After reaching out to and speaking with over 20 in-house analysts — just to get a sense of what it’s really like — I realized something I hadn’t wanted to believe at first:

**In-house analytics can be just as frustrating. Just in different ways.**

You still get Slack messages like:
> “Hey, conversion dropped this week. Can you check if anything looks weird before tomorrow?”

You’re still stitching together three databases that don’t talk to each other.

You still build dashboards that no one uses.  
Only this time, the person not using them sits two rows away.

Access isn’t automatic.  
Alignment isn’t guaranteed.  
And “business impact” is still something you have to push for — it doesn’t land in your inbox wrapped with a ribbon.

So yes, it’s different. But not always better.  
And certainly not easier.

## 4. What I’ve been trying to do instead

Somewhere between the frustration of consulting and the reality check of in-house, I realized:  
**It’s not just about where I work. It’s about how I work.**

So I started asking myself a different set of questions:

- Do I understand what the business actually cares about — or just what they asked me to do?  
- Do I follow up on my work — or just deliver and disappear?  
- Do I know who makes decisions — and what would convince them to change their mind?  
- Do I track if my dashboard was useful — or only if it ran without error?

These are not always comfortable questions.  
But they shifted something in how I see my role.

## 5. Moving beyond “built a dashboard” on my resume

A lot of consulting analysts (myself included) fall into a trap when writing resumes:  
> “Built dashboards and reports for client X, resulting in +15% repurchase rate.”

That sounds nice, but… what does that really mean?

What dashboard leads directly to a 15% increase?  
What did I actually do that mattered?

So I started rewriting my project descriptions. Instead of focusing on *what* I delivered, I try to explain *how* I thought:

> “Researched the client’s retail operations model, identified key metrics including repeat purchase and conversion rate. Used benchmarking across stores to help local teams understand their performance and define next-step goals. Built a dashboard to reflect this framework and support ongoing iteration.”

It’s not shorter. But it’s real.

And it says: I wasn’t just a dashboard person.  
I tried to think with the business, not just build for it.

## 6. The quiet shift — but not always within your control

People often say: “It’s not about where you work, it’s how you think.”

That sounds nice.  
But in reality, where you work — and what role you're placed in — shapes a lot more than people admit.

In consulting, you're almost never seen as part of the business. You're brought in to deliver something specific, and then you're expected to disappear.  
There's usually no real option to stay and follow up, let alone influence the broader system.

In-house roles *can* be different — not always, but they can.  
You might still be stuck doing reporting. You might still be outside the decision room.  
But sometimes, you're allowed to push further.  
You get invited into planning. You're trusted with context. You can build trust over time.

So yes, mindset matters. But environment does too.  
And being honest about those limits is part of the shift.

The question becomes:  
> *When I see a window to participate, am I ready to step into it?*

That’s the quiet shift I’m working on — and hoping I get the chance to make.

## 7. A closing thought

I used to think the problem was the company — that consulting made me feel like a tool.

Now I think the deeper problem is the shape of the role — and whether we’re willing (or allowed) to step outside it.

If you’re reading this and you’re somewhere in the same place — stuck between output and ownership, data and decisions — you’re not alone.

And no matter where you sit, I hope we all keep trying to ask better questions, not just build better dashboards.

Thanks for reading.
