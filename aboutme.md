Hi, I’m Danni Long 👋

A few things about me:

- I try new things at least **3 times** — before I put it away or keep it
- I ask a lot of questions — and sometimes, I find good answers  
- I'm deeply curious about human behavior and how products are designed around it  
- I speak some German — C1-ish, still learning, still suffering 😉

I’m a data analyst with 4+ years of experience turning business chaos into clarity.  
With a background in consulting, I’ve worked across finance, logistics, and product teams to trace operational issues, uncover insights, and build dashboards people actually want to use.

What I care about most:  
**Helping teams make better decisions by making data feel trustworthy, understandable, and just a little bit delightful.**

Whether it’s figuring out why users drop off, debugging a broken order-to-cash flow, or simplifying a chart until the “aha” hits — I love when data makes something *click*.

### When I’m not wrangling data...
You’ll probably find me bouldering, boxing, or reading about psychology and behavior.  
Also: occasionally journaling about life, learning, and why we’re all weird in the best way.

### Currently obsessed with:

#### 🧠 Analytics blog:  
[Avinash Kaushik](https://www.kaushik.net/avinash/) — sharp, funny, and no-BS takes on digital strategy and analytics.
[Yu Dong’s Blog](https://yudong-94.github.io/personal-website/) — thoughtful storytelling on experimentation, data, and product. She’s been publishing one Tableau viz every week since 2018 — quiet consistency I really admire.

#### 🗣️ German learning (with personality):  
- [Your Daily German](https://yourdailygerman.com/) — a wild ride of grammar, humor, and “aha” moments  
- [German To Go](https://germantogo.com/) — great for structured and gentle learning
