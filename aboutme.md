Hi, I’m Danni Long 👋

A few things to know about me:

- I ask a lot of questions — sometimes too many  
- I’m endlessly curious about human behavior and how products are shaped around it  
- I’ve been learning digital drawing in my free time  
- I speak some German (and I'm still learning!)

I'm a data analyst with 4+ years of experience turning complex business questions into clear, actionable insights.  
I come from a consulting background, which taught me how to dive into messy operational systems, trace root causes, and turn raw data into dashboards that people actually use.

What I care most about:  
**Helping teams make better decisions by making data feel trustworthy, approachable, and meaningful.**

Whether it’s analyzing why users drop off, debugging a broken order-to-cash flow, or simplifying a chart so that the “aha” moment lands faster — I love that point where data becomes clarity.

### When I’m not working...
You’ll probably find me bouldering, boxing, or reading about psychology and behavior — because let’s be honest, understanding people is half the job in analytics anyway 🙂
